# Interactive-Car-Ramp

This setup comprises four Arduino (ATmega328p) chips running parallel programs for a game. Six sensors gather input, and 12 seven-segment displays show results. Three chips, each connected to two IR sensors, initiate millisecond timers displayed on four seven-segment displays. The fourth chip determines the winner based on the lowest millisecond count.
